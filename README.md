This is a demo that shows how to produce HTML and Word reports using a Plumber API.

Download it to your machine and run the run_this.R file. The reports will be available on:

* [localhost:8000/test](localhost:8000/test)
* [localhost:8000/word?team=301](localhost:8000/word?team=301)
* [localhost:8000/html?team=301](localhost:8000/html?team=301)

(or it may be a different port from 8000, Plumber will tell you).
